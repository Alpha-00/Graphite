# GUI system

This directory contains the XML files describing the components which make up Graphite's GUI.

## Principles

The framework is inspired by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
Each component's layout is defined in an XML, and recursively made out of lower-level components.

Interactivity is provided by script files which expose reactive variables. As these variables are mutated, the component is updated to match the current state.

## Layout

The layout engine does a top-down pass through the component tree in order to determine what to render.

Layout is controlled using predefined attributes, such as `width`, `height`, `x-align`, `y-align`, `gap` or `padding`.

## Component lifetime

The children of a component are passed to it as a `content` attribute. For example, looking at the row component:
```xml
<row content="INNER_XML: (Layout) = [[]]">
    {{INNER_XML}}
</row>
```
The `content` attribute defines a new variable `INNER_XML` of type `Layout` which can contain more XML layout structure. It has a default value of `[[]]` which refers to an empty layoutâ€” XML syntax (for the `Layout` data type) written in a tag's attribute is wrapped in ``[[`` (opening) and `]]` (closing) symbols. In this case the `INNER_XML` variable defaults to empty XML, however it is not stricly useful here because the `content` attribute will always have its value replaced by whatever exists between opening and closing tags when this component is called from elsewhere.

This is then expanded in the body of the row: `{{INNER_XML}}`.

## Defining new components

### Component files

To define a new component, create a new `.xml` file in this directory. Subdirectories become namespaces for the components (e.g. the file `window/main.xml` defines a component `<window:main>`).

### Parameters

User-defined parameters start with a colon (`:`).

They are created by adding attributes to a component source file:
`:parameter="VARIABLE_NAME: (VariableType) = defaultValue"`
