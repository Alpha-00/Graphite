# GUI System Explainer

This directory contains the XML files describing the components which make up Graphite's GUI.

## Principles

The framework is inspired by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
Each component's layout is defined in an XML, and recursively made out of lower-level components.

Interactivity is provided by script files which expose reactive variables. As these variables are mutated, the component is updated to match the current state.

## Layout

The layout engine does a top-down pass through the component tree in order to determine what to render.

Layout is controlled using predefined attributes, such as `width`, `height`, `x-align`, `y-align`, `gap` or `padding`.

## Component lifetime

The children of a component are passed to it as a `children` attribute. For example, looking at the row component:
```xml
<row children="INNER_XML: (Layout) = [[]]">
    {{INNER_XML}}
</row>
```
The `children` attribute defines a new variable `INNER_XML` of type `Layout` which can contain more XML layout structure. It has a default value of `[[]]` which refers to an empty layout— XML syntax (for the `Layout` data type) written in a tag's attribute is wrapped in ``[[`` (opening) and `]]` (closing) symbols. In this case the `INNER_XML` variable defaults to empty XML, however it is not strictly useful here because the `children` attribute will always have its value replaced by whatever exists between opening and closing tags when this component is called from elsewhere.

This is then expanded in the body of the row: `{{INNER_XML}}`.

## Defining new components

### Component files

To define a new component, create a new `.xml` file in this directory. Subdirectories become namespaces for the components (e.g. the file `window/main.xml` defines a component `<window:main>`).

### Parameters

User-defined parameters start with a colon (`:`).

They are created by adding attributes to a component source file:
`:parameter="VARIABLE_NAME: (VariableType) = defaultValue"`

# GUI System Markup Language Specification

## Layouts

* XML files laying out interface structure with tags for layouts and primitives
* Namespaced with folder name like `<namespace:layout-name>`
* Inner XML content bound to the variable specified in the `children` attribute of the root element definition
* All custom attributes are prefixed with a `:` when used as arguments and as parameters
* Root element in each file is the layout and its accepted arguments with a bound variable and default value
* Templating using {{mustaches}} for bound variables and computed values in the associated script
* Each layout has a companion script (Rust or WASM) that exposes computed values for templating
* Each layout acts as a container element used in computing layout measurements

## GUI layout tree data structure

* Stores purely the data used by the renderer and shaders
* Updated by the layout system

## Primitive layouts

**`<box> | <box />`** Draws a box
* **`children`** *`[xml | none = none]`*  
  Inner XML stays in the document
* **`:fill`** *`[color | none = none]`*  
  Fill color for the box
* **`:round`** *`[size | size size size size = 0px]`*  
  Rounds the corners
* **`:border-thickness`** *`[size = 0px]`*  
  Thickness of the border inside the box
* **`:border-color`** *`[color | none = none]`*  
  Color of the border inside the box

**`<icon> | <icon />`** Draws an icon from an SVG file and optionally contains child elements
* **`children`** *`[xml | none = none]`*  
  Inner XML stays in the document
* **`:svg`** *``[string = `missing_svg_alert.svg`]``*  
  Location of the SVG file
* **`:style`** *```[string = ``]```*  
  CSS styling to be applied to the SVG, useful for applying templated variables

**`<text>`** Draws text
* **`children`** *```[string = ``]```*  
  The text to be drawn (eventually this could become XML for styling)
* **`:color`** *`[color | none = [middlegray]]`*  
  The color of the text
* **`:size`** *`[size = 12px]`*  
  The size of the text

**`<row> | <row />`** Wraps content laid out across vertically-adjacent sections, or acts as a spacer
* **`children`** *`[xml | none = none]`*  
  The elements inside the row

**`<col>`** Wraps content laid out across horizontally-adjacent sections, or acts as a spacer
* **`children`** *`[xml | none = none]`*  
  The elements inside the column

**`<if>`** Conditionally enables or disables child content if :a equals :b
* **`children`** *`[xml | none = none]`*
  The elements to be shown if :a equals :b
* **`:a`** *`[TypeValue = true]`*  
  The first variable that must equal the second variable
* **`:b`** *`[TypeValue = true]`*  
  The second variable that must equal the first variable

## Layout calculation

**`width`** *`[Dimension = inner]`*
Set the exact content width of the element

**`height`** *`[Dimension = inner]`*
Set the exact content height of the element

**`x-align`** *`[Dimension::Percent = 0%]`*
Factor from left (0%) to right (100%) to align content inside this larger element

**`y-align`** *`[Dimension::Percent = 0%]`*
Factor from top (0%) to bottom (100%) to align content inside this larger element

**`gap`** *`[Dimension Dimension Dimension Dimension = 0px 0px 0px 0px]`*
Collapses between neighbors, pushes/expands parent set to inner, not part of click target (negative values count against the interior dimension instead of adding to the outside of the dimension?)
* **gap** *[Dimension → a a a a]*  
  Sugar: Single value for all sides
* **gap** *[Dimension Dimension = a b a b]*  
  Sugar: Two values for top/bottom and left/right
* **x-gap** *[Dimension = 0px a 0px a]*  
  Sugar: Single value for left/right
* **x-gap** *[Dimension Dimension = 0px a 0px b]*  
  Sugar: Two values for left and right
* **y-gap** *[Dimension = a 0px a 0px]*  
  Sugar: Single value for top/bottom
* **y-gap** *[Dimension Dimension = a 0px b 0px]*  
  Sugar: Two values for top and bottom

**`padding`** *`[Dimension Dimension Dimension Dimension = 0]`*
Doesn’t collapse between neighbors, pushes/expands parent set to inner, part of the click target (negative values count against the interior dimension instead of adding to the outside of the dimension?)
* **padding** *[Dimension → a a a a]*  
  Sugar: Single value for all sides
* **padding** *[Dimension Dimension = a b a b]*  
  Sugar: Two values for top/bottom and left/right
* **x-padding** *[Dimension = 0px a 0px a]*  
  Sugar: Single value for left/right
* **x-padding** *[Dimension Dimension = 0px a 0px b]*  
  Sugar: Two values for left and right
* **y-padding** *[Dimension = a 0px a 0px]*  
  Sugar: Single value for top/bottom
* **y-padding** *[Dimension Dimension = a 0px b 0px]*  
  Sugar: Two values for top and bottom

**`scroll`** *`[Dimension::Percent = 0%]`*
When child elements overflow their container, keep them visible on the top/left (0%) or bottom/right (100%) while clipping on the opposite side

## Drawing procedure

Depth or breadth first traversal, shallow nodes drawn before deeper nodes

## Updating and damaged flag  
For any element marked damaged, it and all its children are redrawn
Resizing panels marks all affected panel containers as damaged so the resized contents are drawn

## Antialiased corners

Pass along the parent node’s uniform, for any fragment located within a corner region, render the parent and blend antialiased GUI rectangle over it based on signed-distance function corner

Pixels in the corner regions must be wholly from the parent (must live within the borders of the parent, parent can’t be transparent, parent can’t have a wider overlapping border radius)

Requires a special case for overlapping parent and child with same border radius in same location so only the child is shown to avoid bleeding doubled antialiased edges
